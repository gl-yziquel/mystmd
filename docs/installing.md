description: MyST Markdown is available through Node and npm, install the package with `npm install mystmd`.

To install the MyST CLI, choose your preferred package manager. If you do not know what a package manager is, _it is recommended that you install MyST with `mamba` from conda-forge_.

(installing-myst-tabs)=
:::::{tab-set}
(installing-with-mamba)=
::::{tab-item} conda-forge

Install `mamba` (<https://mamba.readthedocs.io>), see [Getting started with Miniforge](xref:biapol#ref:miniforge_python).

ðŸ›  Then install `mystmd` from `conda-forge`:

```shell
mamba install -c conda-forge mystmd
```

::::
::::{tab-item} PyPI

ðŸ›  Install `mystmd`:

```shell
pip install mystmd
```

ðŸ›  Ensure `mystmd` is ready for use:

MyST needs `node` (<https://nodejs.org>) in order to run correctly. If `node` is not already installed, starting `myst` will prompt you to install it:

```shell
$ myst -v
Node.js (node) is required to run MyST, but could not be found.
Install Node.js in '/root/.local/share/myst/18.0.0'? (y/N): y
Attempting to install Node.js in /root/.local/share/myst/18.0.0 ...
Successfully installed Node.js 18.0.0

```

:::{note} Installing Node.js Manually
:class: dropdown

The `mystmd` package on PyPI ships with the ability to install `node` (<https://nodejs.org>). If you would prefer to install NodeJS manually, see [Installing NodeJS](./install-node.md):
:::

::::
::::{tab-item} NPM

Ensure your `node` (<https://nodejs.org>) is up to date (>v18), see [Installing NodeJS](./install-node.md).

ðŸ›  Then install `mystmd` using npm, yarn or pnpm:

```shell
npm install -g mystmd
```

::::
:::::

This will install `myst` globally (`-g`) on your system and add a link to the main CLI tool. To see if things worked, try checking the version with:

```shell
myst --version
```

This command should print the current version of the package. If all is good, you can type `myst` again in your terminal and it will list the help with all of the options available to you.

```{note}
If you have any challenges installing, please [open an issue here](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues).
